Reading Notes 10:

Today reading will be about how to troubleshoot your code in JavaScript.

1. What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

* Types of error
Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, 
or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, 
as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, 
meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, 
as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

* During my Lab assignements, one of my common mistakes is understanding the flow of my code and the order in need to write them. 
I usually encounter a Syntax errors and Logic errors.

* Today learning will be very helpful during my carrer. Troubleshooting and detect what is wrong in my code a very crucial tool for web developper.

2. The JavaScript Debugger

* The JavaScript debugger
The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

* What is a breakpoint in code?
A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing. For example, if the programmer amended the logic error in the trace table example they may wish to trigger a break point at line 5 in the algorithm.

* The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
